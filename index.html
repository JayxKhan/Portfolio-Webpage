<h2>Hello! My name is Mujahid Hussain AKA Jay</h2>
<p>I am a student with Thinkful located in Tucson, Arizona. A couple of my interest involve:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Video Games</li>
  <li>Learning code</li>
  <li>Boxing</li>
</ul>

<!--put article in for my interest with an unorder list-->
 
<!-- started a main container for my about me segment made sure I paragraphed correctly so everything is not cluttered-->

<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>I was born and raised in Chicago, IL all the way up till I was 19. I then moved to Tucson, AZ to be independent and attend school and finish my degree.</p>
		
	 <p>I initially was going to get my degree in Business and Finance but found I wasn't truly interested in that field. I then stumbled upon coding videos on Youtube and instantly felt that I wanted to pursue it.</p> 
	 
	<p>I believe that pursuing Full stack Development and then transfering into a Computer Science degree fits me well because I love computers and the creative aspect behind coding.</p>
